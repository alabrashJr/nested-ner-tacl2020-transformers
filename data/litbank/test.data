BOOK ONE CHAPTER I ANTHONY PATCH In 1913 , when Anthony Patch was twenty-five , two years were already gone since irony , the Holy Ghost of this later day , had , theoretically at least , descended upon him .

Irony was the final polish of the shoe , the ultimate dab of the clothes-brush , a sort of intellectual " There ! "


-- yet at the brink of this story he has as yet gone no further than the conscious stage .


As you first see him he wonders frequently whether he is not without honor and slightly mad , a shameful and obscene thinness glistening on the surface of the world like oil on a clean pond , these occasions being varied , of course , with those in which he thinks himself rather an exceptional young man , thoroughly sophisticated , well adjusted to his environment , and somewhat more significant than any one else he knows .

This was his healthy state and it made him cheerful , pleasant , and very attractive to intelligent men and to all women .

In this state he considered that he would one day accomplish some quiet subtle thing that the elect would deem worthy and , passing on , would join the dimmer stars in a nebulous , indeterminate heaven half-way between death and immortality .
16,18 PER

Until the time came for this effort he would be Anthony Patch -- not a portrait of a man but a distinct and dynamic personality , opinionated , contemptuous , functioning from within outward -- a man who was aware that there could be no honor and yet had honor , who knew the sophistry of courage and yet was brave .

A WORTHY MAN AND HIS GIFTED SON Anthony drew as much consciousness of social security from being the grandson of Adam J. Patch as he would have had from tracing his line over the sea to the crusaders .

His mind , under the influence of that insidious mildew which eventually forms on all but the few , gave itself up furiously to every indignation of the age .


From an armchair in the office of his Tarrytown estate he directed against the enormous hypothetical enemy , unrighteousness , a campaign which went on through fifteen years , during which he displayed himself a rabid monomaniac , an unqualified nuisance , and an intolerable bore .

The year in which this story opens found him wearying ; his campaign had grown desultory ; 1861 was creeping up slowly on 1895 ; his thoughts ran a great deal on the Civil War , somewhat on his dead wife and son , almost infinitesimally on his grandson Anthony .

It was as a concession to his hypochondriacal imagination that he formed the habit of reading in bed -- it soothed him .


He read until he was tired and often fell asleep with the lights still on .


His favorite diversion until he was fourteen was his stamp collection ; enormous , as nearly exhaustive as a boy 's could be -- his grandfather considered fatuously that it was teaching him geography .

During the whole of a dull , dark , and soundless day in the autumn of the year , when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens , I had been passing alone , on horseback , through a singularly dreary tract of country ; and at length found myself , as the shades of the evening drew on , within view of the melancholy House of Usher .
39,45 LOC|68,69 PER|64,69 FAC

I know not how it was -- but , with the first glimpse of the building , a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit .
14,16 FAC

I say insufferable ; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable , because poetic , sentiment , with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible .


I looked upon the scene before me -- upon the mere house , and the simple landscape features of the domain -- upon the bleak walls -- upon the vacant eye-like windows -- upon a few rank sedges -- and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees -- with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium -- the bitter lapse into everyday life -- the hideous dropping off of the veil .

There was an iciness , a sinking , a sickening of the heart -- an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime .


What was it -- I paused to think -- what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher ?
23,24 PER|20,24 FAC

It was a mystery all insoluble ; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered .


I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion , that while , beyond doubt , there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us , still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth .


It was possible , I reflected , that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene , of the details of the picture , would be sufficient to modify , or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and , acting upon this idea , I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling , and gazed down -- but with a shudder even more thrilling than before -- upon the remodelled and inverted images of the grey sedge , and the ghastly tree-stems , and the vacant and eye-like windows .

It was the manner in which all this , and much more , was said -- it was the apparent heart that went with his request -- which allowed me no room for hesitation ; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons .

There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition -- for why should I not so term it ?

Such , I have long known , is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis .

19,22 FAC|27,29 LOC

I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity -- an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven , but which had reeked up from the decayed trees , and the grey wall , and the silent tarn -- a pestilent and mystic vapour , dull , sluggish , faintly discernible , and leaden-hued .

Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream , I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building .

Its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity .


The discoloration of ages had been great .


Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior , hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves .

Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation .


No portion of the masonry had fallen ; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts , and the crumbling condition of the individual stones .


In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault , with no disturbance from the breath of the external air .


Beyond this indication of extensive decay , however , the fabric gave little token of instability .


Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure , which , extending from the roof of the building in front , made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction , until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn .

Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable .

And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features , and of the expression they were wont to convey , lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke .

The night watchman and housekeeper , who had waited up to receive me , were thrown into an awful flutter .

They had never seen the like of Sing , and thought that I was introducing a wolf into the fold .


I reassured them as to his dogginess , and the watchman , after studying his black tongue , ventured a witticism .

He wanted to know if I fed him on huckleberry pie .


It was difficult to find accommodations for my family .

Jane did not fare much better .
0,1 PER

There was not an extra bed in the building , barring a five-foot crib in the hospital room .
7,9 FAC|15,18 FAC

She , as you know , approaches six .


We tucked her in , and she spent the night folded up like a jackknife .


She has limped about today , looking like a decrepit letter S , openly deploring this latest escapade on the part of her flighty mistress , and longing for the time when we shall come to our senses , and return to the parental fireside in Worcester .

Having her here is the silliest idea that was ever conceived , but you know my family .
2,3 FAC|15,17 PER

I fought their objections step by step , but they made their last stand on Jane .


If I brought her along to see that I ate nourishing food and did n't stay up all night , I might come -- temporarily ; but if I refused to bring her -- oh , dear me , I am not sure that I was ever again to cross the threshold of Stone Gate !

I woke by a gong at six this morning , and lay for a time listening to the racket that twenty-five little girls made in the lavatory over my head .

While my little charges were at breakfast , it seemed a happy time to introduce myself ; so I sought the dining room .

Really , Judy , I never knew there was any spot in the world so entirely ugly ; and when I saw those rows and rows of pale , listless , blue-uniformed children , the whole dismal business suddenly struck me with such a shock that I almost collapsed .

It seemed like an unachievable goal for one person to bring sunshine to one hundred little faces when what they need is a mother apiece .
7,9 PER|22,24 PER

I plunged into this thing lightly enough , partly because you were too persuasive , and mostly , I honestly think , because that scurrilous Gordon Hallock laughed so uproariously at the idea of my being able to manage an asylum .

Between you all you hypnotized me .


And then of course , after I began reading up on the subject and visiting all those seventeen institutions , I got excited over orphans , and wanted to put my own ideas into practice .

I started to tell you about my first official speech at breakfast this morning .


It dealt with all the wonderful new changes that are to come to the John Grier Home through the generosity of Mr. Jervis Pendleton , the president of our board of trustees , and of Mrs. Pendleton , the dear " Aunt Judy " of every little boy and girl here .

I did it for political reasons .


As the entire working staff of the institution was present , I thought it a good opportunity to emphasize the fact that all of these upsetting , innovations come straight from headquarters , and not out of my excitable brain .
