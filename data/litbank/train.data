I appear today as I did forty years and more ago , and yet I feel that I can not go on living forever ; that some day I shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection .


I do not know why I should fear death , I who have died twice and am still alive ; but yet I have the same horror of it as you who have never died , and it is because of this terror of death , I believe , that I am so convinced of my mortality .


And because of this conviction I have determined to write down the story of the interesting periods of my life and of my death .


I can not explain the phenomena ; I can only set down here in the words of an ordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events that befell me during the ten years that my dead body lay undiscovered in an Arizona cave .

At the close of the Civil War I found myself possessed of several hundred thousand dollars ( Confederate ) and a captain 's commission in the cavalry arm of an army which no longer existed ; the servant of a state which had vanished with the hopes of the South .

Masterless , penniless , and with my only means of livelihood , fighting , gone , I determined to work my way to the southwest and attempt to retrieve my fallen fortunes in a search for gold .


I spent nearly a year prospecting in company with another Confederate officer , Captain James K. Powell of Richmond .
9,12 PER|13,14 PER|18,19 GPE|13,19 PER

We were extremely fortunate , for late in the winter of 1865 , after many hardships and privations , we located the most remarkable gold-bearing quartz vein that our wildest dreams had ever pictured .

Powell , who was a mining engineer by education , stated that we had uncovered over a million dollars worth of ore in a trifle over three months .

As Powell was familiar with the country , as well as with the mechanical requirements of mining we determined that it would be best for him to make the trip .

It was agreed that I was to hold down our claim against the remote possibility of its being jumped by some wandering prospector .

On March 3 , 1866 , Powell and I packed his provisions on two of our burros , and bidding me good-bye he mounted his horse , and started down the mountainside toward the valley , across which led the first stage of his journey .
6,7 PER|30,32 LOC|33,35 LOC

The morning of Powell 's departure was , like nearly all Arizona mornings , clear and beautiful ; I could see him and his little pack animals picking their way down the mountainside toward the valley , and all during the morning I would catch occasional glimpses of them as they topped a hog back or came out upon a level plateau .

Some half hour later I happened to glance casually across the valley and was much surprised to note three little dots in about the same place I had last seen my friend and his two pack animals .

I am not given to needless worrying , but the more I tried to convince myself that all was well with Powell , and that the dots I had seen on his trail were antelope or wild horses , the less I was able to assure myself .
21,22 PER

Since we had entered the territory we had not seen a hostile Indian , and we had , therefore , become careless in the extreme , and were wont to ridicule the stories we had heard of the great numbers of these vicious marauders that were supposed to haunt the trails , taking their toll in lives and torture of every white party which fell into their merciless clutches .
4,6 PER|10,13 PER|37,69 PER|60,69 PER

Finally I could endure the suspense no longer , and , arming myself with my two Colt revolvers and a carbine , I strapped two belts of cartridges about me and catching my saddle horse , started down the trail taken by Powell in the morning .
42,43 PER|38,43 FAC

As soon as I reached comparatively level ground I urged my mount into a canter and continued this , where the going permitted , until , close upon dusk , I discovered the point where other tracks joined those of Powell .
40,41 PER

They were the tracks of unshod ponies , three of them , and the ponies had been galloping .


I followed rapidly until , darkness shutting down , I was forced to await the rising of the moon , and given an opportunity to speculate on the question of the wisdom of my chase .


Possibly I had conjured up impossible dangers , like some nervous old housewife , and when I should catch up with Powell would get a good laugh for my pains .
9,13 PER|21,22 PER

However , I am not prone to sensitiveness , and the following of a sense of duty , wherever it may lead , has always been a kind of fetich with me throughout my life ; which may account for the honors bestowed upon me by three republics and the decorations and friendships of an old and powerful emperor and several lesser kings , in whose service my sword has been red many a time .
54,59 PER|60,75 PER

About nine o'clock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to proceed on my way and I had no difficulty in following the trail at a fast walk , and in some places at a brisk trot until , about midnight , I reached the water hole where Powell had expected to camp .
22,24 FAC|48,49 PER|44,53 LOC

I came upon the spot unexpectedly , finding it entirely deserted , with no signs of having been recently occupied as a camp .
3,5 LOC|21,23 FAC

I was interested to note that the tracks of the pursuing horsemen , for such I was now convinced they must be , continued after Powell with only a brief stop at the hole for water ; and always at the same rate of speed as his .
9,22 PER|25,26 PER|32,36 LOC

I was positive now that the trailers were Apaches and that they wished to capture Powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture , so I urged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace , hoping against hope that I would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him .
5,7 PER|8,9 PER|15,16 PER|46,49 PER

Further speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of two shots far ahead of me .


I knew that Powell would need me now if ever , and I instantly urged my horse to his topmost speed up the narrow and difficult mountain trail .

I had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing further sounds , when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small , open plateau near the summit of the pass .

The fact , however , that this thought did not occur to me until the following day removes any possible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of this episode might possibly otherwise entitle me .


I do not believe that I am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes , because , in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary acts have placed me face to face with death , I can not recall a single one where any alternative step to that I took occurred to me until many hours later .
13,14 PER

My mind is evidently so constituted that I am subconsciously forced into the path of duty without recourse to tiresome mental processes .


However that may be , I have never regretted that cowardice is not optional with me .


In this instance I was , of course , positive that Powell was the center of attraction , but whether I thought or acted first I do not know , but within an instant from the moment the scene broke upon my view I had whipped out my revolvers and was charging down upon the entire army of warriors , shooting rapidly , and whooping at the top of my lungs .

Riding close to him I reached down from the saddle , and grasping his cartridge belt drew him up across the withers of my mount .

After spending a week in Cape Town , finding that they overcharged me at the hotel , and having seen everything there was to see , including the botanical gardens , which seem to me likely to confer a great benefit on the country , and the new Houses of Parliament , which I expect will do nothing of the sort , I determined to go back to Natal by the _ Dunkeld _ , then lying at the docks waiting for the _ Edinburgh Castle _ due in from England .

Among these passengers who came on board were two who excited my curiosity .
1,7 PER|8,13 PER

One , a gentleman of about thirty , was perhaps the biggest-chested and longest-armed man I ever saw .
2,7 PER|10,18 PER

He had yellow hair , a thick yellow beard , clear-cut features , and large grey eyes set deep in his head .


I never saw a finer-looking man , and somehow he reminded me of an ancient Dane .
3,6 PER|13,16 PER

Not that I know much of ancient Danes , though I knew a modern Dane who did me out of ten pounds ; but I remember once seeing a picture of some of those gentry , who , I take it , were a kind of white Zulus .
6,8 PER|12,22 PER|31,35 PER|43,48 PER

They were drinking out of big horns , and their long hair hung down their backs .


As I looked at my friend standing there by the companion-ladder , I thought that if he only let his grow a little , put one of those chain shirts on to his great shoulders , and took hold of a battle-axe and a horn mug , he might have sat as a model for that picture .
4,11 PER|52,57 PER

And by the way it is a curious thing , and just shows how the blood will out , I discovered afterwards that Sir Henry Curtis , for that was the big man 's name , is of Danish blood .
23,24 PER|23,26 PER|30,33 PER

[ 1 ] He also reminded me strongly of somebody else , but at the time I could not remember who it was .

The other man , who stood talking to Sir Henry , was stout and dark , and of quite a different cut .
8,9 PER|0,10 PER|8,10 PER

I suspected at once that he was a naval officer ; I do n't know why , but it is difficult to mistake a navy man .

5,8 LOC|12,13 PER|31,32 PER

Well , to return , I proved right again ; I ascertained that the dark man _ was _ a naval officer , a lieutenant of thirty-one , who , after seventeen years ' service , had been turned out of her Majesty 's employ with the barren honour of a commander 's rank , because it was impossible that he should be promoted .

The officer 's name I found out -- by referring to the passengers ' lists -- was Good -- Captain John Good .
0,2 PER|11,13 PER|17,18 PER|19,20 PER|19,22 PER

He was broad , of medium height , dark , stout , and rather a curious man to look at .
14,20 PER

He was so very neat and so very clean-shaved , and he always wore an eye-glass in his right eye .


It seemed to grow there , for it had no string , and he never took it out except to wipe it .


At first I thought he used to sleep in it , but afterwards I found that this was a mistake .


He put it in his trousers pocket when he went to bed , together with his false teeth , of which he had two beautiful sets that , my own being none of the best , have often caused me to break the tenth commandment .


But I am anticipating .

" Have you got any money to buy your breakfast ? "


" No , but I 'll soon get some . "


While this conversation had been going on , Dick had got up .
8,9 PER

His bedchamber had been a wooden box half full of straw , on which the young boot-black had reposed his weary limbs , and slept as soundly as if it had been a bed of down .
0,2 FAC|14,17 PER|4,36 FAC

He dumped down into the straw without taking the trouble of undressing .


Getting up too was an equally short process .


He jumped out of the box , shook himself , picked out one or two straws that had found their way into rents in his clothes , and , drawing a well-worn cap over his uncombed locks , he was all ready for the business of the day .
4,6 FAC

Dick 's appearance as he stood beside the box was rather peculiar .
0,1 PER|7,9 FAC

His pants were torn in several places , and had apparently belonged in the first instance to a boy two sizes larger than himself .
17,24 PER

He wore a vest , all the buttons of which were gone except two , out of which peeped a shirt which looked as if it had been worn a month .


To complete his costume he wore a coat too long for him , dating back , if one might judge from its general appearance , to a remote antiquity .


Washing the face and hands is usually considered proper in commencing the day , but Dick was above such refinement .
15,16 PER

He had no particular dislike to dirt , and did not think it necessary to remove several dark streaks on his face and hands .


But in spite of his dirt and rags there was something about Dick that was attractive .
12,13 PER

It was easy to see that if he had been clean and well dressed he would have been decidedly good-looking .


Some of his companions were sly , and their faces inspired distrust ; but Dick had a frank , straight-forward manner that made him a favorite .
0,4 PER|14,15 PER

Dick 's business hours had commenced .

He had no office to open .

Is n't that a little steep ? "


" Well , you know ' taint all clear profit , " said Dick , who had already set to work .

" There 's the _ blacking _ costs something , and I have to get a new brush pretty often . "


" And you have a large rent too , " said the gentleman quizzically , with a glance at a large hole in Dick 's coat .
11,13 PER|23,24 PER

Another of Dick 's faults was his extravagance .
2,3 PER

Being always wide-awake and ready for business , he earned enough to have supported him comfortably and respectably .


There were not a few young clerks who employed Dick from time to time in his professional capacity , who scarcely earned as much as he , greatly as their style and dress exceeded his .
3,7 PER|9,10 PER

But Dick was careless of his earnings .
1,2 PER

Where they went he could hardly have told himself .


However much he managed to earn during the day , all was generally spent before morning .


He was fond of going to the Old Bowery Theatre , and to Tony Pastor 's , and if he had any money left afterwards , he would invite some of his friends in somewhere to have an oyster-stew ; so it seldom happened that he commenced the day with a penny .
6,10 FAC|13,15 PER|13,16 FAC|29,33 PER

Then I am sorry to add that Dick had formed the habit of smoking .
7,8 PER

This cost him considerable , for Dick was rather fastidious about his cigars , and would n't smoke the cheapest .
6,7 PER

Besides , having a liberal nature , he was generally ready to treat his companions .
13,15 PER

But of course the expense was the smallest objection .

He was above doing anything mean or dishonorable .


He would not steal , or cheat , or impose upon younger boys , but was frank and straight-forward , manly and self-reliant .

Chapter I .


THE MAGNET ATTRACTING -- A WAIF AMID FORCES When Caroline Meeber boarded the afternoon train for Chicago , her total outfit consisted of a small trunk , a cheap imitation alligator-skin satchel , a small lunch in a paper box , and a yellow leather snap purse , containing her ticket , a scrap of paper with her sister 's address in Van Buren Street , and four dollars in money .

It was in August , 1889 .


She was eighteen years of age , bright , timid , and full of the illusions of ignorance and youth .


Whatever touch of regret at parting characterised her thoughts , it was certainly not for advantages now being given up .


A gush of tears at her mother 's farewell kiss , a touch in her throat when the cars clacked by the flour mill where her father worked by the day , a pathetic sigh as the familiar green environs of the village passed in review , and the threads which bound her so lightly to girlhood and home were irretrievably broken .

CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , ‘ and what is the use of a book , ’ thought Alice ‘ without pictures or conversations ? ’
3,5 LOC|5,6 PER|15,17 PER|18,20 LOC|37,39 PER|64,65 PER

So she was considering in her own mind ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) , whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .

There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that ; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself , ‘ Oh dear !

Oh dear !


I shall be late ! ’


( when she thought it over afterwards , it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this , but at the time it all seemed quite natural ) ; but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET , and looked at it , and then hurried on , Alice started to her feet , for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket , or a watch to take out of it , and burning with curiosity , she ran across the field after it , and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge .

32,34 FAC

She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled ‘ ORANGE MARMALADE ’ , but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it .

There are no mice in the air , I ’m afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that ’s very like a mouse , you know .

And here Alice began to get rather sleepy , and went on saying to herself , in a dreamy sort of way , ‘ Do cats eat bats ?

Do cats eat bats ? ’


and sometimes , ‘ Do bats eat cats ? ’


for , you see , as she could n’t answer either question , it did n’t much matter which way she put it .


She felt that she was dozing off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah , and saying to her very earnestly , ‘ Now , Dinah , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ? ’


when suddenly , thump !

down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over .


Alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the White Rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it .

She was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof .

There were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .
5,7 FAC|16,17 PER

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and Alice ’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas !
27,28 PER|42,44 FAC

either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them .


However , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !


Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat-hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw .

How she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; ‘ and even if my head would go through , ’ thought poor Alice , ‘ it would be of very little use without my shoulders .
7,10 FAC|15,20 LOC|50,51 PER

Oh , how I wish I could shut up like a telescope !

For , you see , so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately , that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible .
14,15 PER

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , [ ‘ which certainly was not here before , ’ said Alice , ) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ‘ DRINK ME ’ beautifully printed on it in large letters .

It was all very well to say ‘ Drink me , ’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry .
13,17 PER

‘ No , I ’ll look first , ’ she said , ‘ and see whether it ’s marked “ poison ” or not ’ ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘ poison , ’ it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .
35,51 PER|61,63 PER

However , this bottle was NOT marked ‘ poison , ’ so Alice ventured to taste it , and finding it very nice , ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart , custard , pine-apple , roast turkey , toffee , and hot buttered toast , ) she very soon finished it off .

Words are sometimes very poor exponents of such an event : but it happens now and then , on the other hand , that a plain intimation expresses too much , and suggests emotion and suffering which , in reality , have but little , if any , existence .

There are some rare natures that are content to acquiesce in the general neglect , and forget themselves when they find themselves forgotten ; but it is unfortunately much more usual to take the plan adopted by Mrs Marjoribanks , who devoted all her powers , during the last ten years of her life , to the solacement and care of that poor self which other people neglected .

She was not , however , exactly the kind of figure for this _ mise en scène _ .

Here the case was very different , as might have been expected from the duke 's love of the _ bizarre _ .
13,15 PER

The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time .
0,2 FAC

There was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards , and at each turn a novel effect .


To the right and left , in the middle of each wall , a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite .
22,32 FAC|30,32 FAC

These windows were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened .
19,25 FAC

The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries , and here the panes were purple .

The third was green throughout , and so were the casements .

The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange -- the fifth with white -- the sixth with violet .

The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls , falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue .
0,3 FAC

But in this chamber only , the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations .
2,4 FAC

The panes here were scarlet -- a deep blood colour .
2,3 FAC

Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum , amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof .
2,4 PER|2,8 FAC|5,8 FAC

There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers .
13,17 FAC

But in the corridors that followed the suite , there stood , opposite to each window , a heavy tripod , bearing a brazier of fire , that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room .
2,8 FAC|6,8 FAC|39,41 FAC

And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances .


But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes , was ghastly in the extreme , and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered , that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all .
2,7 FAC|46,50 PER|48,50 PER

It was in this apartment , also , that there stood against the western wall , a gigantic clock of ebony .
3,5 FAC

Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull , heavy , monotonous clang ; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face , and the hour was to be stricken , there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical , but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that , at each lapse of an hour , the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause , momentarily , in their performance , to harken to the sound ; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions ; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company ; and , while the chimes of the clock yet rang , it was observed that the giddiest grew pale , and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation .
73,78 PER|97,99 PER|111,115 PER|131,133 PER|137,142 PER

But when the echoes had fully ceased , a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly ; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly , and made whispering vows , each to the other , that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion ; and then , after the lapse of sixty minutes , ( which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies , ) there came yet another chiming of the clock , and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before .

It was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be _ sure _ that he was not .


He had directed , in great part , the movable embellishments of the seven chambers , upon occasion of this great _ fête _ ; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders .
12,15 FAC|37,39 PER

Be sure they were grotesque .


There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm -- much of what has been since seen in " Hernani " .


There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments .


There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions .
6,8 PER

There were much of the beautiful , much of the wanton , much of the _ bizarre _ , something of the terrible , and not a little of that which might have excited disgust .


To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked , in fact , a multitude of dreams .
4,7 FAC

And these -- the dreams -- writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms , and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps .
13,15 FAC|22,24 PER

And , anon , there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet .

And then , for a moment , all is still , and all is silent save the voice of the clock .


The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand .


But the echoes of the chime die away -- they have endured but an instant -- and a light , half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart .


And now again the music swells , and the dreams live , and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever , taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods .


But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven , there are now none of the maskers who venture ; for the night is waning away ; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes ; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals ; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet , there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches _ their _ ears who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments .

And then the music ceased , as I have told ; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted ; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before .

But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock ; and thus it happened , perhaps , that more of thought crept , with more of time , into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled .
38,44 PER|41,44 PER

And thus too , it happened , perhaps , that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence , there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before .

In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted , it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation .

Nippers , the second on my list , was a whiskered , sallow , and , upon the whole , rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty .
0,1 PER|9,29 PER

I always deemed him the victim of two evil powers -- ambition and indigestion .


The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the duties of a mere copyist , an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly professional affairs , such as the original drawing up of legal documents .
12,15 PER

The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous testiness and grinning irritability , causing the teeth to audibly grind together over mistakes committed in copying ; unnecessary maledictions , hissed , rather than spoken , in the heat of business ; and especially by a continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked .


Though of a very ingenious mechanical turn , Nippers could never get this table to suit him .
8,9 PER

He put chips under it , blocks of various sorts , bits of pasteboard , and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite adjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper .


But no invention would answer .


If , for the sake of easing his back , he brought the table lid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin , and wrote there like a man using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk : -- then he declared that it stopped the circulation in his arms .
36,39 FAC|29,42 PER

If now he lowered the table to his waistbands , and stooped over it in writing , then there was a sore aching in his back .


In short , the truth of the matter was , Nippers knew not what he wanted .
10,11 PER

Or , if he wanted any thing , it was to be rid of a scrivener 's table altogether .


Among the manifestations of his diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from certain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats , whom he called his clients .
16,28 PER|26,28 PER

But with all his failings , and the annoyances he caused me , Nippers , like his compatriot Turkey , was a very useful man to me ; wrote a neat , swift hand ; and , when he chose , was not deficient in a gentlemanly sort of deportment .
13,14 PER|16,27 PER

Added to this , he always dressed in a gentlemanly sort of way ; and so , incidentally , reflected credit upon my chambers .


Whereas with respect to Turkey , I had much ado to keep him from being a reproach to me .

His clothes were apt to look oily and smell of eating-houses .
10,11 FAC

He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in summer .


His coats were execrable ; his hat not to be handled .

21,24 PER|35,37 FAC

Concerning his coats , I reasoned with him ; but with no effect .


The truth was , I suppose , that a man of so small an income , could not afford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the same time .

Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress .

Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters ; and her profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments , which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible , -- or from one of our elder poets , -- in a paragraph of to-day 's newspaper .

Such reasons would have been enough to account for plain dress , quite apart from religious feeling ; but in Miss Brooke 's case , religion alone would have determined it ; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister 's sentiments , only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation .

In the former case , it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare he pleases ; and though this should be very indifferent , and utterly disagreeable to the taste of his company , they must not find any fault ; nay , on the contrary , good breeding forces them outwardly to approve and to commend whatever is set before them .

In that part of the western division of this kingdom which is commonly called Somersetshire , there lately lived , and perhaps lives still , a gentleman whose name was Allworthy , and who might well be called the favourite of both nature and fortune ; for both of these seem to have contended which should bless and enrich him most .

In this contention , nature may seem to some to have come off victorious , as she bestowed on him many gifts , while fortune had only one gift in her power ; but in pouring forth this , she was so very profuse , that others perhaps may think this single endowment to have been more than equivalent to all the various blessings which he enjoyed from nature .


From the former of these , he derived an agreeable person , a sound constitution , a solid understanding , and a benevolent heart ; by the latter , he was decreed to the inheritance of one of the largest estates in the county .

This loss , however great , he bore like a man of sense and constancy , though it must be confest he would often talk a little whimsically on this head ; for he sometimes said he looked on himself as still married , and considered his wife as only gone a little before him , a journey which he should most certainly , sooner or later , take after her ; and that he had not the least doubt of meeting her again in a place where he should never part with her more -- sentiments for which his sense was arraigned by one part of his neighbours , his religion by a second , and his sincerity by a third .

My father , who was very ancient , had given me a competent share of learning , as far as house-education and a country free school generally go , and designed me for the law ; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will , nay , the commands of my father , and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends , that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature , tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me .

He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand , or of aspiring , superior fortunes on the other , who went abroad upon adventures , to rise by enterprise , and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road ; that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me ; that mine was the middle state , or what might be called the upper station of low life , which he had found , by long experience , was the best state in the world , the most suited to human happiness , not exposed to the miseries and hardships , the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind , and not embarrassed with the pride , luxury , ambition , and envy of the upper part of mankind .
5,23 PER|98,100 LOC|121,126 PER|141,146 PER

He told me I might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing — viz .


that this was the state of life which all other people envied ; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things , and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes , between the mean and the great ; that the wise man gave his testimony to this , as the standard of felicity , when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches .
8,11 PER|14,15 PER|50,53 PER

He bade me observe it , and I should always find that the calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind , but that the middle station had the fewest disasters , and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind ; nay , they were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses , either of body or mind , as those were who , by vicious living , luxury , and extravagances on the one hand , or by hard labour , want of necessaries , and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand , bring distemper upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living ; that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments ; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune ; that temperance , moderation , quietness , health , society , all agreeable diversions , and all desirable pleasures , were the blessings attending the middle station of life ; that this way men went silently and smoothly through the world , and comfortably out of it , not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head , not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread , nor harassed with perplexed circumstances , which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest , nor enraged with the passion of envy , or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things ; but , in easy circumstances , sliding gently through the world , and sensibly tasting the sweets of living , without the bitter ; feeling that they are happy , and learning by every day ’s experience to know it more sensibly .

After this he pressed me earnestly , and in the most affectionate manner , not to play the young man , nor to precipitate myself into miseries which nature , and the station of life I was born in , seemed to have provided against ; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread ; that he would do well for me , and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had just been recommending to me ; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the world , it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it ; and that he should have nothing to answer for , having thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt ; in a word , that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he directed , so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away ; and to close all , he told me I had my elder brother for an example , to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars , but could not prevail , his young desires prompting him to run into the army , where he was killed ; and though he said he would not cease to pray for me , yet he would venture to say to me , that if I did take this foolish step , God would not bless me , and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery .

September in that latitude was marked by the sudden cool night breeze following shortly after sundown .

BOOK ONE THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS CHAPTER ONE THE EVE OF THE WAR No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man 's and yet as mortal as his own ; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied , perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water .

Yet across the gulf of space , minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish , intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic , regarded this earth with envious eyes , and slowly and surely drew their plans against us .
5,6 LOC|32,34 LOC

And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment .


The planet Mars , I scarcely need remind the reader , revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles , and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world .

4,5 PER|14,16 PER|36,37 LOC

The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour .
7,9 LOC|15,17 LOC

Its physical condition is still largely a mystery , but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter .


Its air is much more attenuated than ours , its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface , and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones .

The Return THERE WAS SOMETHING about the coast town of Dunnet which made it seem more attractive than other maritime villages of eastern Maine .

Perhaps it was the simple fact of acquaintance with that neighborhood which made it so attaching , and gave such interest to the rocky shore and dark woods , and the few houses which seemed to be securely wedged and tree-nailed in among the ledges by the Landing .

These houses made the most of their seaward view , and there was a gayety and determined floweriness in their bits of garden ground ; the small-paned high windows in the peaks of their steep gables were like knowing eyes that watched the harbor and the far sea-line beyond , or looked northward all along the shore and its background of spruces and balsam firs .

At first the tiny house of Mrs. Almira Todd , which stood with its end to the street , appeared to be retired and sheltered enough from the busy world , behind its bushy bit of a green garden , in which all the blooming things , two or three gay hollyhocks and some London-pride , were pushed back against the gray-shingled wall .

With most remedies the purchaser was allowed to depart unadmonished from the kitchen , Mrs. Todd being a wise saver of steps ; but with certain vials she gave cautions , standing in the doorway , and there were other doses which had to be accompanied on their healing way as far as the gate , while she muttered long chapters of directions , and kept up an air of secrecy and importance to the last .

On the 5th of November , which was the beginning of summer in those parts , the weather being very hazy , the seamen spied a rock within half a cable ’s length of the ship ; but the wind was so strong , that we were driven directly upon it , and immediately split .

For my own part , I swam as fortune directed me , and was pushed forward by wind and tide .


I often let my legs drop , and could feel no bottom ; but when I was almost gone , and able to struggle no longer , I found myself within my depth ; and by this time the storm was much abated .


The declivity was so small , that I walked near a mile before I got to the shore , which I conjectured was about eight o’clock in the evening .
0,2 LOC|16,18 LOC

I then advanced forward near half a mile , but could not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants ; at least I was in so weak a condition , that I did not observe them .
16,17 FAC|18,19 PER

I was extremely tired , and with that , and the heat of the weather , and about half a pint of brandy that I drank as I left the ship , I found myself much inclined to sleep .
29,31 VEH

I lay down on the grass , which was very short and soft , where I slept sounder than ever I remembered to have done in my life , and , as I reckoned , about nine hours ; for when I awaked , it was just day-light .


I attempted to rise , but was not able to stir : for , as I happened to lie on my back , I found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground ; and my hair , which was long and thick , tied down in the same manner .


I likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body , from my arm-pits to my thighs .


I could only look upwards ; the sun began to grow hot , and the light offended my eyes .


I heard a confused noise about me ; but in the posture I lay , could see nothing except the sky .


In a little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg , which advancing gently forward over my breast , came almost up to my chin ; when , bending my eyes downwards as much as I could , I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high , with a bow and arrow in his hands , and a quiver at his back .
46,53 PER

In the mean time , I felt at least forty more of the same kind ( as I conjectured ) following the first .
9,15 PER

I was in the utmost astonishment , and roared so loud , that they all ran back in a fright ; and some of them , as I was afterwards told , were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground .


However , they soon returned , and one of them , who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face , lifting up his hands and eyes by way of admiration , cried out in a shrill but distinct voice , _ Hekinah degul _ : the others repeated the same words several times , but then I knew not what they meant .


I lay all this while , as the reader may believe , in great uneasiness .
7,9 PER

At length , struggling to get loose , I had the fortune to break the strings , and wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground ; for , by lifting it up to my face , I discovered the methods they had taken to bind me , and at the same time with a violent pull , which gave me excessive pain , I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left side , so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches .


But the creatures ran off a second time , before I could seize them ; whereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent , and after it ceased I heard one of them cry aloud _ Tolgo phonac _ ; when in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand , which , pricked me like so many needles ; and besides , they shot another flight into the air , as we do bombs in Europe , whereof many , I suppose , fell on my body , ( though I felt them not ) , and some on my face , which I immediately covered with my left hand .
84,85 GPE

When this shower of arrows was over , I fell a groaning with grief and pain ; and then striving again to get loose , they discharged another volley larger than the first , and some of them attempted with spears to stick me in the sides ; but by good luck I had on a buff jerkin , which they could not pierce .


I thought it the most prudent method to lie still , and my design was to continue so till night , when , my left hand being already loose , I could easily free myself : and as for the inhabitants , I had reason to believe I might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me , if they were all of the same size with him that I saw .
39,41 PER

But fortune disposed otherwise of me .


When the people observed I was quiet , they discharged no more arrows ; but , by the noise I heard , I knew their numbers increased ; and about four yards from me , over against my right ear , I heard a knocking for above an hour , like that of people at work ; when turning my head that way , as well as the pegs and strings would permit me , I saw a stage erected about a foot and a half from the ground , capable of holding four of the inhabitants , with two or three ladders to mount it : from whence one of them , who seemed to be a person of quality , made me a long speech , whereof I understood not one syllable .

But I should have mentioned , that before the principal person began his oration , he cried out three times , _ Langro dehul san _ ( these words and the former were afterwards repeated and explained to me ) ; whereupon , immediately , about fifty of the inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my head , which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right , and of observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak .

He acted every part of an orator , and I could observe many periods of threatenings , and others of promises , pity , and kindness .
5,7 PER

I answered in a few words , but in the most submissive manner , lifting up my left hand , and both my eyes to the sun , as calling him for a witness ; and being almost famished with hunger , having not eaten a morsel for some hours before I left the ship , I found the demands of nature so strong upon me , that I could not forbear showing my impatience ( perhaps against the strict rules of decency ) by putting my finger frequently to my mouth , to signify that I wanted food .

He descended from the stage , and commanded that several ladders should be applied to my sides , on which above a hundred of the inhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth , laden with baskets full of meat , which had been provided and sent thither by the king ’s orders , upon the first intelligence he received of me .
21,26 PER|24,26 PER|48,50 PER

I observed there was the flesh of several animals , but could not distinguish them by the taste .


There were shoulders , legs , and loins , shaped like those of mutton , and very well dressed , but smaller than the wings of a lark .


I ate them by two or three at a mouthful , and took three loaves at a time , about the bigness of musket bullets .


They supplied me as fast as they could , showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and appetite .


I then made another sign , that I wanted drink .


They found by my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me ; and being a most ingenious people , they slung up , with great dexterity , one of their largest hogsheads , then rolled it towards my hand , and beat out the top ; I drank it off at a draught , which I might well do , for it did not hold half a pint , and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy , but much more delicious .
16,20 PER|78,79 LOC

They brought me a second hogshead , which I drank in the same manner , and made signs for more ; but they had none to give me .


When I had performed these wonders , they shouted for joy , and danced upon my breast , repeating several times as they did at first , _ Hekinah degul _ .


They made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads , but first warning the people below to stand out of the way , crying aloud , _ Borach mevolah _ ; and when they saw the vessels in the air , there was a universal shout of _ Hekinah degul _ .
17,20 PER

I confess I was often tempted , while they were passing backwards and forwards on my body , to seize forty or fifty of the first that came in my reach , and dash them against the ground .


But the remembrance of what I had felt , which probably might not be the worst they could do , and the promise of honour I made them — for so I interpreted my submissive behaviour — soon drove out these imaginations .


Besides , I now considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality , to a people who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence .
15,27 PER

However , in my thoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive mortals , who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body , while one of my hands was at liberty , without trembling at the very sight of so prodigious a creature as I must appear to them .

0,2 PER|22,27 PER|76,79 GPE

I answered in few words , but to no purpose , and made a sign with my hand that was loose , putting it to the other ( but over his excellency ’s head for fear of hurting him or his train ) and then to my own head and body , to signify that I desired my liberty .
30,32 PER

It appeared that he understood me well enough , for he shook his head by way of disapprobation , and held his hand in a posture to show that I must be carried as a prisoner .
34,36 PER

However , he made other signs to let me understand that I should have meat and drink enough , and very good treatment .


Whereupon I once more thought of attempting to break my bonds ; but again , when I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands , which were all in blisters , and many of the darts still sticking in them , and observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased , I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased .
52,54 PER

Upon this , the _ hurgo _ and his train withdrew , with much civility and cheerful countenances .


Soon after I heard a general shout , with frequent repetitions of the words _ Peplom selan _ ; and I felt great numbers of people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree , that I was able to turn upon my right , and to ease myself with making water ; which I very plentifully did , to the great astonishment of the people ; who , conjecturing by my motion what I was going to do , immediately opened to the right and left on that side , to avoid the torrent , which fell with such noise and violence from me .

These circumstances , added to the refreshment I had received by their victuals and drink , which were very nourishing , disposed me to sleep .


I slept about eight hours , as I was afterwards assured ; and it was no wonder , for the physicians , by the emperor ’s order , had mingled a sleepy potion in the hogsheads of wine .

THE SCARLET LETTER I .


THE PRISON DOOR A throng of bearded men , in sad-coloured garments and grey steeple-crowned hats , inter-mixed with women , some wearing hoods , and others bareheaded , was assembled in front of a wooden edifice , the door of which was heavily timbered with oak , and studded with iron spikes .

The founders of a new colony , whatever Utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project , have invariably recognised it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery , and another portion as the site of a prison .
3,6 GPE|37,39 FAC|47,49 FAC

In accordance with this rule it may safely be assumed that the forefathers of Boston had built the first prison-house somewhere in the Vicinity of Cornhill , almost as seasonably as they marked out the first burial-ground , on Isaac Johnson 's lot , and round about his grave , which subsequently became the nucleus of all the congregated sepulchres in the old churchyard of King 's Chapel .

Like all that pertains to crime , it seemed never to have known a youthful era .


Before this ugly edifice , and between it and the wheel-track of the street , was a grass-plot , much overgrown with burdock , pig-weed , apple-pern , and such unsightly vegetation , which evidently found something congenial in the soil that had so early borne the black flower of civilised society , a prison .
1,4 FAC|12,14 FAC|16,55 FAC|53,55 FAC

But on one side of the portal , and rooted almost at the threshold , was a wild rose-bush , covered , in this month of June , with its delicate gems , which might be imagined to offer their fragrance and fragile beauty to the prisoner as he went in , and to the condemned criminal as he came forth to his doom , in token that the deep heart of Nature could pity and be kind to him .
45,47 PER|54,57 PER

This rose-bush , by a strange chance , has been kept alive in history ; but whether it had merely survived out of the stern old wilderness , so long after the fall of the gigantic pines and oaks that originally overshadowed it , or whether , as there is fair authority for believing , it had sprung up under the footsteps of the sainted Ann Hutchinson as she entered the prison-door , we shall not take upon us to determine .

Finding it so directly on the threshold of our narrative , which is now about to issue from that inauspicious portal , we could hardly do otherwise than pluck one of its flowers , and present it to the reader .

Perhaps a fifth part of her mind was thus occupied , and the remaining parts leapt over the little barrier of day which interposed between Monday morning and this rather subdued moment , and played with the things one does voluntarily and normally in the daylight .


But although she was silent , she was evidently mistress of a situation which was familiar enough to her , and inclined to let it take its way for the six hundredth time , perhaps , without bringing into play any of her unoccupied faculties .

During those six weeks I lived in a world of dandelions and delights .


The dandelions carpeted the three lawns , -- they used to be lawns , but have long since blossomed out into meadows filled with every sort of pretty weed , -- and under and among the groups of leafless oaks and beeches were blue hepaticas , white anemones , violets , and celandines in sheets .

CHAPTER I .


THE TWO POETS OF SAFFRON PARK THE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London , as red and ragged as a cloud of sunset .

It was built of a bright brick throughout ; its sky-line was fantastic , and even its ground plan was wild .


It had been the outburst of a speculative builder , faintly tinged with art , who called its architecture sometimes Elizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne , apparently under the impression that the two sovereigns were identical .
6,34 PER|31,36 PER

It was described with some justice as an artistic colony , though it never in any definable way produced any art .


But although its pretensions to be an intellectual centre were a little vague , its pretensions to be a pleasant place were quite indisputable .

Thus , and thus only , the whole place had properly to be regarded ; it had to be considered not so much as a workshop for artists , but as a frail but finished work of art .

This again was more strongly true of the many nights of local festivity , when the little gardens were often illuminated , and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish trees like some fierce and monstrous fruit .

He put the old cant of the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain impudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure .


He was helped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance , which he worked , as the phrase goes , for all it was worth .


His dark red hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman ’s , and curved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre-Raphaelite picture .

From within this almost saintly oval , however , his face projected suddenly broad and brutal , the chin carried forward with a look of cockney contempt .

It looked like the end of the world .

All the heaven seemed covered with a quite vivid and palpable plumage ; you could only say that the sky was full of feathers , and of feathers that almost brushed the face .


Across the great part of the dome they were grey , with the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale green ; but towards the west the whole grew past description , transparent and passionate , and the last red-hot plumes of it covered up the sun like something too good to be seen .


The whole was so close about the earth , as to express nothing but a violent secrecy .

It expressed that splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism .

During the earlier years of this period , elegance of personal appearance was believed to rest more upon the texture of garments than upon their shaping .


A silk dress needed no remodelling when it was a year or so old ; it remained distinguished by merely remaining silk .


Old men and governors wore broadcloth ; “ full dress ” was broadcloth with “ doeskin ” trousers ; and there were seen men of all ages to whom a hat meant only that rigid , tall silk thing known to impudence as a “ stove-pipe . ”

Trousers with a crease were considered plebeian ; the crease proved that the garment had lain upon a shelf , and hence was “ ready-made ” ; these betraying trousers were called “ hand-me-downs , ” in allusion to the shelf .

After the young woman in the glass cage had held up to him across her counter the pale-pink leaflet bearing his friend 's name , which she neatly pronounced , he turned away to find himself , in the hall , facing a lady who met his eyes as with an intention suddenly determined , and whose features -- not freshly young , not markedly fine , but on happy terms with each other -- came back to him as from a recent vision .

It was n't till after he had spoken that he became aware of how much there had been in him of response ; when the tone of her own rejoinder , as well as the play of something more in her face -- something more , that is , than its apparently usual restless light -- seemed to notify him .

Her qualification of the mentioned connexion had rather removed than placed a dish , and there seemed nothing else to serve .


Their attitude remained , none the less , that of not forsaking the board ; and the effect of this in turn was to give them the appearance of having accepted each other with an absence of preliminaries practically complete .

4,6 PER

When in a quarter of an hour he came down , what his hostess saw , what she might have taken in with a vision kindly adjusted , was the lean , the slightly loose figure of a man of the middle height and something more perhaps than the middle age -- a man of five-and-fifty , whose most immediate signs were a marked bloodless brownness of face , a thick dark moustache , of characteristically American cut , growing strong and falling low , a head of hair still abundant but irregularly streaked with grey , and a nose of bold free prominence , the even line , the high finish , as it might have been called , of which , had a certain effect of mitigation .

A perpetual pair of glasses astride of this fine ridge , and a line , unusually deep and drawn , the prolonged pen-stroke of time , accompanying the curve of the moustache from nostril to chin , did something to complete the facial furniture that an attentive observer would have seen catalogued , on the spot , in the vision of the other party to Strether 's appointment .
45,48 PER|65,66 PER

She waited for him in the garden , the other party , drawing on a pair of singularly fresh soft and elastic light gloves and presenting herself with a superficial readiness which , as he approached her over the small smooth lawn and in the watery English sunshine , he might , with his rougher preparation , have marked as the model for such an occasion .

She had , this lady , a perfect plain propriety , an expensive subdued suitability , that her companion was not free to analyse , but that struck him , so that his consciousness of it was instantly acute , as a quality quite new to him .
3,5 PER|17,19 PER

Before reaching her he stopped on the grass and went through the form of feeling for something , possibly forgotten , in the light overcoat he carried on his arm ; yet the essence of the act was no more than the impulse to gain time .


Nothing could have been odder than Strether 's sense of himself as at that moment launched in something of which the sense would be quite disconnected from the sense of his past and which was literally beginning there and then .
6,7 PER

It had begun in fact already upstairs and before the dressing glass that struck him as blocking further , so strangely , the dimness of the window of his dull bedroom ; begun with a sharper survey of the elements of Appearance than he had for a long time been moved to make .

He had during those moments felt these elements to be not so much to his hand as he should have liked , and then had fallen back on the thought that they were precisely a matter as to which help was supposed to come from what he was about to do .


He was about to go up to London , so that hat and necktie might wait .
7,8 GPE

What had come as straight to him as a ball in a well-played game -- and caught moreover not less neatly -- was just the air , in the person of his friend , of having seen and chosen , the air of achieved possession of those vague qualities and quantities that collectively figured to him as the advantage snatched from lucky chances .
28,33 PER

Without pomp or circumstance , certainly , as her original address to him , equally with his own response , had been , he would have sketched to himself his impression of her as : " Well , she 's more thoroughly civilized -- ! "


If " More thoroughly than WHOM ? "

To begin my life with the beginning of my life , I record that I was born ( as I have been informed and believe ) on a Friday , at twelve o’clock at night .


It was remarked that the clock began to strike , and I began to cry , simultaneously .


In consideration of the day and hour of my birth , it was declared by the nurse , and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted , first , that I was destined to be unlucky in life ; and secondly , that I was privileged to see ghosts and spirits ; both these gifts inevitably attaching , as they believed , to all unlucky infants of either gender , born towards the small hours on a Friday night .

I was born with a caul , which was advertised for sale , in the newspapers , at the low price of fifteen guineas .


Whether sea-going people were short of money about that time , or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets , I do n’t know ; all I know is , that there was but one solitary bidding , and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-broking business , who offered two pounds in cash , and the balance in sherry , but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain .
1,3 PER|43,50 PER

Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss -- for as to sherry , my poor dear mother ’s own sherry was in the market then -- and ten years afterwards , the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country , to fifty members at half-a-crown a head , the winner to spend five shillings .

I was present myself , and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused , at a part of myself being disposed of in that way .


The caul was won , I recollect , by an old lady with a hand-basket , who , very reluctantly , produced from it the stipulated five shillings , all in halfpence , and twopence halfpenny short -- as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic , to endeavour without any effect to prove to her .
9,15 PER

It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there , that she was never drowned , but died triumphantly in bed , at ninety-two .


I have understood that it was , to the last , her proudest boast , that she never had been on the water in her life , except upon a bridge ; and that over her tea ( to which she was extremely partial ) she , to the last , expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others , who had the presumption to go ‘ meandering ’ about the world .

It was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences , tea perhaps included , resulted from this objectionable practice .

CHAPTER I TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH Among other public buildings in a certain town , which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning , and to which I will assign no fictitious name , there is one anciently common to most towns , great or small : to wit , a workhouse ; and in this workhouse was born ; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat , inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader , in this stage of the business at all events ; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter .

For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble , by the parish surgeon , it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all ; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared ; or , if they had , that being comprised within a couple of pages , they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography , extant in the literature of any age or country .

Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse , is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being , I do mean to say that in this particular instance , it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred .
12,14 FAC|28,31 PER|49,51 PER

The fact is , that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration , -- a troublesome practice , but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence ; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress , rather unequally poised between this world and the next : the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter .

2,3 PER|9,24 PER|26,28 FAC|26,35 PER|36,37 PER

The result was , that , after a few struggles , Oliver breathed , sneezed , and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish , by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage , a voice , for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter .

Upon this , the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved , that Oliver should be ' farmed , ' or , in other words , that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off , where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws , rolled about the floor all day , without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing , under the parental superintendence of an elderly female , who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week .

Unfortunately for , the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over , a similar result usually attended the operation of _ her _ system ; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food , it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten , either that it sickened from want and cold , or fell into the fire from neglect , or got half-smothered by accident ; in any one of which cases , the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world , and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this .

Occasionally , when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead , or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing -- though the latter accident was very scarce , anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm -- the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions , or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance .

Though there was already talk of the erection , in remote metropolitan distances " above the Forties , " of a new Opera House which should compete in costliness and splendour with those of the great European capitals , the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every winter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy .
34,38 GPE|20,38 FAC|32,38 FAC|58,62 FAC

Conservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient , and thus keeping out the " new people " whom New York was beginning to dread and yet be drawn to ; and the sentimental clung to it for its historic associations , and the musical for its excellent acoustics , always so problematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music .

But , in the first place , New York was a metropolis , and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was " not the thing " to arrive early at the opera ; and what was or was not " the thing " played a part as important in Newland Archer 's New York as the inscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his forefathers thousands of years ago .
