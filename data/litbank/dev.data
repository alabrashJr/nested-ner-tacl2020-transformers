I A STRANGER FROM SOUTH CAROLINA Time touches all things with destroying hand ; and if he seem now and then to bestow the bloom of youth , the sap of spring , it is but a brief mockery , to be surely and swiftly followed by the wrinkles of old age , the dry leaves and bare branches of winter .

And yet there are places where Time seems to linger lovingly long after youth has departed , and to which he seems loath to bring the evil day .

Some such trite reflection -- as apposite to the subject as most random reflections are -- passed through the mind of a young man who came out of the front door of the Patesville Hotel about nine o'clock one fine morning in spring , a few years after the Civil War , and started down Front Street toward the market-house .

Arriving at the town late the previous evening , he had been driven up from the steamboat in a carriage , from which he had been able to distinguish only the shadowy outlines of the houses along the street ; so that this morning walk was his first opportunity to see the town by daylight .

There had been some changes , it is true , some melancholy changes , but scarcely anything by way of addition or improvement to counterbalance them .

CHAPTER I Chiswick Mall While the present century was in its teens , and on one sunshiny morning in June , there drove up to the great iron gate of Miss Pinkerton 's academy for young ladies , on Chiswick Mall , a large family coach , with two fat horses in blazing harness , driven by a fat coachman in a three-cornered hat and wig , at the rate of four miles an hour .

The earliest known traditions describe the stone as having been set in the forehead of the four-handed Indian god who typifies the Moon .

Partly from its peculiar colour , partly from a superstition which represented it as feeling the influence of the deity whom it adorned , and growing and lessening in lustre with the waxing and waning of the moon , it first gained the name by which it continues to be known in India to this day -- the name of THE MOONSTONE .

A similar superstition was once prevalent , as I have heard , in ancient Greece and Rome ; not applying , however ( as in India ) , to a diamond devoted to the service of a god , but to a semi-transparent stone of the inferior order of gems , supposed to be affected by the lunar influences -- the moon , in this latter case also , giving the name by which the stone is still known to collectors in our own time .

From the records of the Colonial Office and from the dead man 's diary we learn that a certain young English nobleman , whom we shall call John Clayton , Lord Greystoke , was commissioned to make a peculiarly delicate investigation of conditions in a British West Coast African Colony from whose simple native inhabitants another European power was known to be recruiting soldiers for its native army , which it used solely for the forcible collection of rubber and ivory from the savage tribes along the Congo and the Aruwimi .

When he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled .


The preferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service , and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility ; but , on the other hand , he had been married to the Hon. Alice Rutherford for scarce a three months , and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that appalled him .

In regard to my answer , I must humbly request your Ladyship to write to this effect : " That I would not , upon any account , intentionally offend Madame Duval ; but that I have weighty , nay unanswerable reasons for detaining her grand-daughter at present in England ; the principal of which is , that it was the earnest desire of one to whose will she owes implicit duty .

Madame Duval may be assured , that she meets with the utmost attention and tenderness ; that her education , however short of my wishes , almost exceeds my abilities ; and I flatter myself , when the time arrives that she shall pay her duty to her grand-mother , Madame Duval will find no reason to be dissatisfied with what has been done for her .

Madame Duval is by no means a proper companion or guardian for a young woman : she is at once uneducated and unprincipled ; ungentle in temper , and unamiable in her manners .

I can only regard her as an object of pity !


I dare not hesitate at a request from Mrs. Mirvan ; yet , in complying with it , I shall , for her own sake , be as concise as I possibly can ; since the cruel transactions which preceded the birth of my ward can afford no entertainment to a mind so humane as her 's .

His unhappy marriage , immediately upon his return to England , with Madame Duval , then a waiting-girl at a tavern , contrary to the advice and entreaties of all his friends , among whom I was myself the most urgent , induced him to abandon his native land , and fix his abode in France .

Thither he was followed by shame and repentance ; feelings which his heart was not framed to support ; for , notwithstanding he had been too weak to resist the allurements of beauty , which nature , though a niggard to her of every other boon , had with a lavish hand bestowed on his wife ; yet he was a young man of excellent character , and , till thus unaccountably infatuated , of unblemished conduct .

He survived this ill-judged marriage but two years .


Upon his death-bed , with an unsteady hand , he wrote me the following note : " My friend , forget your resentment , in favour of your humanity ; - a father , trembling for the welfare of his child , bequeaths her to your care .

Mr. Evelyn left to me a legacy of a thousand pounds , and the sole guardianship of his daughter 's person till her eighteenth year ; conjuring me , in the most affecting terms , to take the charge of her education till she was able to act with propriety for herself ; but , in regard to fortune , he left her wholly dependent on her mother , to whose tenderness he earnestly recommended her .

Thus , though he would not , to a woman low-bred and illiberal as Mrs. Evelyn , trust the conduct and morals of his daughter , he nevertheless thought proper to secure to her the respect and duty to which , from her own child , were certainly her due ; but unhappily , it never occurred to him that the mother , on her part , could fail in affection or justice .

How often have I since regretted that I did not accompany her thither !


Protected and supported by me , the misery and disgrace which awaited her might perhaps have been avoided .


But , to be brief-Madame Duval , at the instigation of her husband , earnestly , or rather tyrannically , endeavoured to effect a union between Miss Evelyn and one of his nephews .

And , when she found her power inadequate to her attempt , enraged at her non-compliance , she treated her with the grossest unkindness , and threatened her with poverty and ruin .


Miss Evelyn , to whom wrath and violence had hitherto been strangers , soon grew weary of such usage ; and rashly , and without a witness , consented to a private marriage with Sir John Belmont , a very profligate young man , who had but too successfully found means to insinuate himself into her favour .
